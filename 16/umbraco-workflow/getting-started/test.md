this file contains a bunch of common errors and styleguide issues to test automations

## Acronyms and abbreviations

the CMS (content management system) is sometimes called CMS but its best to define it first.  
dont confuse API and api usage. also, abbreviations like SQL or HTML should be capitalized.  
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol and should be spelled out on first use.

- Missing periods in list items  
- Inconsistent comma usage, like this, or this  
- Double spaces after periods. like this.

## Repeated repeated words and typos

This is a test test to see if repeated repeated words can be caught.  
The the system should flag those those mistakes.

## Lists capitalization inconsistency

- First item with lowercase  
- Second Item starting with uppercase  
- Third item with lowercase again  
- `cmd`

1. Numbered list item one  
2. Numbered list item two (lowercase start)  
3. Numbered List Item Three (uppercase start)

## Contractions and informal language

Don't use contractions like can't, won't, shouldn't in official documentation.  
It's better to write do not, will not, should not.  
gonna test informal language like gonna and kinda too. It's so simple to do it.

Easily upload your files and downlading it is so simple.

## Passive voice vs active voice

The content is managed by the admin.  
Users are allowed to edit their profiles.  
Errors are fixed by developers quickly.
